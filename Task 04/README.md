# Task 04 – House Price Prediction 🏡

In this task, I used linear regression to predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.

## 📌 Steps I Followed:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Scaled numerical columns
3. Encoded the categorical column (`Location`)
4. Split the data into training and test sets
5. Built a pipeline using `LinearRegression`
6. Evaluated the model with MSE and R² score

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional)

## 📊 What I Learned:
- Real-world data needs preprocessing before modeling
- How pipelines simplify ML workflows
- How to measure model performance
