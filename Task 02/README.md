# Task 02 – Sales Data Analysis and Prediction 📈

This task was part of my data science internship at **Main Flow Services**, where I worked on analyzing and visualizing a small sales dataset to understand trends and build a simple prediction model.

## 🧪 What I Did:

1. **Explored the dataset** to understand the data types and check for missing values.
2. **Cleaned and prepared** the dataset by converting the date column and sorting the data.
3. **Visualized sales over time** using line plots.
4. **Compared categories** using bar charts.
5. **Plotted profit vs. discount** to see how discounts affect profit.
6. **Built a basic Linear Regression model** to predict sales using profit and discount.

## 📊 Tools Used:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📎 Outcome:
- Learned how to analyze trends over time.
- Understood how to compare different product categories.
- Built a simple but working sales prediction model using linear regression.
