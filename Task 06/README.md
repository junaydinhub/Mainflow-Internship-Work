# Task 06 â€“ Forecasting & Classification

This task includes two real-world mini-projects:
1. ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting â€“ Sales Prediction
2. ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction â€“ Logistic Regression

---

## Project 1: Monthly Sales Forecasting (ARIMA)

### âœ… Steps:
- Loaded and plotted 3 years of monthly sales
- Checked stationarity using rolling stats & ADF test
- Applied differencing to make series stationary
- Trained an ARIMA(1,1,1) model
- Forecasted next 6 months of sales

### ðŸ“Œ Tools Used:
- pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels

---

## Project 2: Predicting Heart Disease

### âœ… Steps:
- Loaded and explored patient health data
- Visualized correlations using heatmap
- Trained logistic regression model
- Evaluated predictions with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

### ðŸ“Œ Tools Used:
- pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn
