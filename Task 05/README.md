## ðŸ§ª Project 1: Student Pass/Fail Prediction

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Predict if a student will pass based on study hours and attendance.

### ðŸ”§ Steps:
- Loaded a dataset of student performance
- Visualized the relationship between study hours, attendance, and results
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

### âœ… What I Learned:
- Basic classification using logistic regression
- How to split and preprocess simple numeric data
- Interpreting confusion matrices

## ðŸ’¬ Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Classify customer reviews as Positive or Negative using text data.

### ðŸ”§ Steps:
- Created a small dataset of review texts and labels
- Used `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text to numerical features
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

### âœ… What I Learned:
- Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Vectorizing text with TF-IDF
- Sentiment classification and evaluation
