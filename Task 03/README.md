# Task 03 – Customer Segmentation using KMeans 🧠

In this task, I performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques as part of my internship with **Main Flow Services**.

## 🧭 Objective:
To identify different customer groups based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## 📌 Steps Followed:

1. **Loaded and explored** the customer dataset.
2. **Preprocessed the data** using feature scaling.
3. **Used the Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Applied KMeans Clustering** to segment the customers.
5. **Visualized the clusters** using a scatter plot.
6. **Interpreted the results** to understand characteristics of each cluster.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📈 What I Learned:
- How to preprocess features for clustering
- Use of Elbow method for finding optimal clusters
- Real-world use of KMeans to group similar customers

## 📁 Screenshots:
All steps are documented with screenshots in the `Screenshots/` folder.

## 🙌 Thanks To:
**Main Flow Services** for assigning real-world inspired tasks that helped me build practical skills in data analysis and unsupervised learning.
